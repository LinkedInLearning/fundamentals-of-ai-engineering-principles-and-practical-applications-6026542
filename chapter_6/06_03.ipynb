    "\n",
    "2. Performance considerations: The fusion approach requires running both retrievers, which can be more expensive. In production, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Running retrievers in parallel\n",
    "    - Using a faster first-stage retriever (typically BM25) to filter candidates\n",
    "    - Caching results for common queries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Beyond simple weighting: More sophisticated approaches include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Using machine learning to learn optimal weights\n",
    "    - Adjusting weights dynamically based on query type\n",
    "    - Implementing reciprocal rank fusion, which considers result positions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Evaluation: Always evaluate your hybrid approach on a diverse set of queries to ensure it's performing better than either method alone.\""
